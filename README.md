# WordCountSorter

Test assignment for a company which should remain nameless :)

#### Problem statement:<br>
Count the words in a file and sort them by frequency of occurence ([Russian translation](https://github.com/andronov-alexey/WordCountSorter/blob/master/docs/Problem%20statement.txt))

#### Possible improvements:<br>
- Validate command line arguments in a separate "Validator" class.<br>
- Move algorithm steps into "Solution" class to keep "main" function clean and tidy<br>


## Usage:<br>
./freq.exe in.txt out.txt

## Build:<br>
- Use CMake<br>
- builded binaries are available [here](https://github.com/andronov-alexey/WordCountSorter/tree/master/bin) and on [releases](https://github.com/andronov-alexey/WordCountSorter/releases) page

#### Developed using MSVC 2022 on Windows
